# EasyHabit

A straightforward open-source habit tracker built with React and TailwindCSS.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, JavaScript TailwindCSS, HTML, Date-FNS
Easyhabit uses browser local storage to carry over data between visits. Uses the Date-FNS library to handle everything date-related, because dates are a headache.  

## Lessons Learned:

This was a really fun project. This is the most ambitious project I've built thus far, so there were some challenges, particularly choosing good variable names, and structuring data in a way that makes sense at scale. Good comments have been invaluable over the course of development. 

Making everything look good with one habit or eight on both mobile and desktop was an interesting design challenge - I spent a lot of time with it, and I'm happy with the result.

## Future Development:

I plan to implement a Node backend with a login so that users can carry over across devices. Stay tuned!
